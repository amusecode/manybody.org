<H3> HISTORY </H3>

In June, 2002, Piet Hut and Mike Shara organized a one-week workshop
in New York, at the American Museum of Natural History, bringing
together experts from stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, stellar
hydrodynamics, as well as other interested astrophysicists and
computer scientists.  At the end of the meeting, the acronym MODEST
was coined, and the meeting was renamed MODEST-1.  It was decided to
continue with a series of biannual meetings, with MODEST-2 in
Amsterdam, in December of 2002, and MODEST-3 in Melbourne to coincide
with the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union.
