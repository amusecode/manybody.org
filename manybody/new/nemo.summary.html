<H3> SUMMARY </H3>

<B>NEMO</B> is a software environment for stellar dynamics. It has
many tools to setup, integrate and analyze N-body datasets, as
well as various derived types of data. A library of routines (mostly
in C) is provided with which new programs can be written. Users
invoke programs just like any other program within the Unix environment,
and shell scripts can be efficiently used to orchestrate large and
complex simulations.
