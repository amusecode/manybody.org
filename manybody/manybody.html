<H3> SUMMARY </H3>

The aim of this web site is to present a convenient entry point for
various activities related to our simulations of stellar systems.  The
<a href=grape.html>GRAPE</a> project, short for GRAvitational
PipelinE, has produced special purpose hardware for stellar dynamics,
at a speed approaching 100 Teraflops.  We offer various open source
software environments such as <a href=nemo.html>NEMO</a> and <a
href=starlab.html>STARLAB</a> for setting up, running, and analyzing
large-scale simulations in stellar dynamics.  Another open source
toolbox is the <a href=partiview.html>PARTIVIEW</a> visualization
package, which can be used on various platforms, from laptops to
virtual reality environments such as the Cave at NCSA and the Hayden
Planetarium in New York City.  Finally, we are in the process of
setting up our <a href=archives.html>ARCHIVE</a> system, where we plan
to make the full results of our largest runs freely available for
guest observers.  We are currently coordinating these efforts with
various Virtual Observatory initiatives.

<P> The <a href=http://manybody.org><tt>manybody.org</tt></a> web page
also includes the home page for <a
href=http://manybody.org/modest>MODEST</a> (MOdeling DEnse STellar
systems), a collaboration between various groups working in stellar
dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.

<H3> HISTORY </H3>

For many years we have accumulated information about our hardware and
software projects at various websites, such as those for <a
href=nemo.html>NEMO</a>, <a href=starlab.html>STARLAB</a>, and <a
href=grape.html>GRAPE</a>, three projects that started in the late
eighties.  By the end of the year 2000, we decided to acquire our own
domain name, manybody.org.  At first we simply used this site to
provide pointers, but we intend to provide a more structured set of
guides to the various projects we are involved in.  We will try to
update these introductory pages frequently.  Note for colleagues: if
you would like us to link your web site from an appropriate leaf in
our site tree, please send us your address and a very brief
description of the content of your site.
