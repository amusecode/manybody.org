<h1>MODEST Working Group 5:
<br>
Simulating Observations of Simulations
</h1><br>

<img src=http://manybody.org/wg5_image.gif alt="hyades_ccd" align=right>

We have developed extensive software environments and simulation codes
to model star clusters.  Now is time to get feedback from observers,
so that we can present our increasingly realistic data in a way that
is most useful for direct comparison with observations.  At the same
time we can give feedback to observers, indicating what would be most
useful for us, to learn from new observations.  And of course, in this
process, we would like to compare notes with other theoreticians as
well.
