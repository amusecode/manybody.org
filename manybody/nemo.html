<H3> SUMMARY </H3>

<B>NEMO</B> is a software environment for stellar dynamics. It has
many tools to setup, integrate and analyze N-body datasets, as
well as various derived types of data. A library of routines (mostly
in C) is provided with which new programs can be written. Users
invoke programs just like any other program within the Unix environment,
and shell scripts can be efficiently used to orchestrate large and
complex simulations.


<H3> HISTORY </H3>

The first version of <B>NEMO</B> was written 
in 1986/87 by Joshua Barnes, Piet Hut and Peter Teuben, while
at the Institute for Advanced Study. Since then, it has expanded
and included many utilities to initialize, integrate, analyze and
visualize N-body data, and various new and related types of data, such
as <I>Orbits</I>, 
 <I>Images</I>,  <I>FITS files</I>,  and
 <I>Tables</I>.  It has also been ported to a larger set of machines.
