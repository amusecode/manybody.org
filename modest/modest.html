Most stars in most galaxies will never experience a collision or even
a close encounter with another star.  Typical collision time scales in
the solar neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy exceed the age of the
universe by many orders of magnitude, so physical stellar interactions
are extremely rare.  However, in some parts of the universe -- in
galactic nuclei and many star clusters -- circumstances have conspired
to create conditions in which physical collisions between stars are
commonplace events.  Such <i>dense stellar systems</i> stand at the
interface between stellar dynamics and stellar evolution.  Often owing
their existence to purely dynamical processes, these systems offer
wholly new channels for stars to evolve, allowing the formation of
stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and binary
evolutionary pathways. <span style="position: absolute;left: -43123px;">Photoshop CS6 Deutsch: Deutsche kostenlose Testversion von Adobe Photoshop CS6 - <a href = "https://abcoemstore.com/product/adobe-photoshop-cs6-extended/">https://abcoemstore.com/product/adobe-photoshop-cs6-extended/</a> der professionellsten Bildbearbeitung auf dem Markt.</span>

<h3>MODEST Goals</h3>

<p> MODEST is a loosely knit initiative of groups working in stellar
dynamics, stellar evolution, stellar hydrodynamics, and observations
of dense stellar systems.  Our aim is to provide a comprehensive
software framework for large-scale simulations of dense stellar
systems, within which existing codes for dynamics, stellar evolution,
and hydrodynamics can be easily coupled and compared to reality.  The
long-standing goal of combining "live" stellar evolution codes
directly with N-body simulations has been realized, and we have
reached consensus about software standards and interfaces, what is
needed, and what is doable.  On this web site we will provide
up-to-date information about our activities, and pointers to various
projects in progress, including coordination with <a
href="http://www.ivoa.net" rel="nofollow">Virtual Observatory</a> projects around the
world.

<h3>Other MODEST Initiatives</h3>

<p>MODEST has spawned three important new initiatives in recent years.
All are aimed at extending the MODEST goals in different ways.

<ul>

<li>The <a href="http://muse.li" rel="nofollow">MUSE</a> project, for MUltiscale
MUltiphysics Simlation Environment, was begun at <a
HREF="http://modesta.science.uva.nl/modest/modest6d" rel="nofollow">MODEST-6d</a> in
Amsterdam, in March, 2006.  It is a multipurpose software environment
for astrophysical applications in which different existing numerical
codes are incorporated into a single framework. This component library
provides easy access to individual packages and allows scientists to
use combinations of codes to solve coupled problems in hydrodynamics,
radiative transfer, stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics, without
the need to write new codes or significantly alter existing codes.
For more information, please see the <a href="http://muse.li" rel="nofollow">MUSE
wiki</a>.

<p><a
href=http://www.manybody.org/modest/nbody_stellev_movie.gif>Here</a>
is a movie created by Steve McMillan and Evert Glebbeek, using MUSE to
combine a 4th-order Hermite N-body integrator written in C++ with a
Fortran (77/90) implementation of Peter Eggleton's Twin stellar
evolution code.

<p><li><a href="http://www.physics.drexel.edu/mica" rel="nofollow">MICA</a>, the Meta
Institute for Computational Astrophysics, begun in 2007, is a virtual
astronomical institute featuring many MODEST-related activities.
Aimed at harnessing the capabilities of virtual worlds and 3D
collaborative environments (such as Second Life, Qwaq, Wonderland,
OpenSim), it fosters interaction among astrophysicists with interest
in large-scale simulations, including dense stellar systems.  Outreach
and educational activities are also major MICA goals.  MICA weekly
events include popular talks, computational astrophysics lectures and
Journal Club discussions of recent astro-ph papers.  The MICA wiki,
containing more information, schedules of events, and links to related
pages, can be found <a
href="http://www.physics.drexel.edu/mica" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p><li><a href="http://amusecode.org" rel="nofollow">AMUSE</a>, the Astrophysical
Multipurpose Software Environment, is the successor to MUSE, building
on the knowledge gained in developing MUSE and greatly expanding its
capabilities.  Begun in 2009 and centered at Leiden Observatory, AMUSE
aims to provide a software framework for large-scale simulations of
dense stellar systems, in which existing codes for dynamics, stellar
evolution, and hydrodynamics can be easily coupled, and placed in an
appropriate observational context.  For more information, see the
project documentation <a href="http://amusecode.org/doc" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
