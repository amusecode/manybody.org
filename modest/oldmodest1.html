Most stars in most galaxies will never experience a collision or even
a close encounter with another star.  Typical collision time scales in
the solar neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy exceed the age of the
universe by many orders of magnitude, so physical stellar interactions
are extremely rare.  However, in some parts of the universe -- in
galactic nuclei and some star clusters -- circumstances have conspired
to create conditions in which physical collisions between stars are
commonplace events.  Such <i>dense stellar systems</i> stand at the
interface between stellar dynamics and stellar evolution.  Often owing
their existence to purely dynamical processes, dense stellar systems
offer wholly new channels for stars to evolve, allowing the formation
of stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and
binary evolutionary pathways.

<p>

MODEST is a loosely knit collaboration between various groups working
in stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.
Our aim is to provide a software framework for large-scale simulations
of dense stellar systems, within which existing codes for dynamics,
stellar evolution, and hydrodynamics can be easily coupled.  While
many of us have talked for years about combining `live' stellar
evolution codes directly with N-body simulations, we have now reached
a consensus between various groups about standards and interfaces,
what is needed, and what is doable.  On this web site we will provide
up-to-date information about our activities, and pointers to various
projects in progress.

<p> Although neither we nor our project goals could possibly be
described as modest, we use the acronym to point out that we intend
only MODEST modifications of existing codes, in order to model dense
stellar systems.  So the acronym can also be read as MODifying
Existing STellar codes.

<p> MODEST is organized into 9 working groups spanning our areas of
interest.  For more information, look on our (still evolving) <a
href=faq.html>FAQ page</a>, or visit one of the working groups.  To
participate in the ongoing MODEST e-mail discussions, see the
information provided below under LINKS.  In addition, our half-yearly
informal workshops, also described below, provide a venue for
face-to-face discussion and collaboration.
