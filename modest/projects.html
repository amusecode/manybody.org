MODEST: Projects
</font></h1>

The purpose of this page is to provide links to current MODEST-related
projects, and to act as a informal forum for new ideas and
collaborative projects related to dense stellar systems in general,
and MODEST in particular.  All are welcome to contribute.

<!--
<h2>Collaborative Project</h2>

<ul>

<li> <a href=http://modesta.science.uva.nl/modest/SOS/M67>Modeling
	M67</a>, a collaborative effort to model the cluster and
	compare simulation techniques.  Theory will confront
	observations at a future MODEST meeting.
</ul>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href=http://www.physics.drexel.edu/mica>MICA</a>, the Meta
     Institute for Computational Astrophysics, is a virtual astronomy
     institute featuring many MODEST-related activities.  Aimed at
     harnessing the capabilities of virtual worlds and 3D
     collaborative environments (such as Second Life, Qwaq, Sun
     Wonderland), it fosters interaction among astrophysicists with
     interest in large-scale simulations, including dense stellar
     systems.

<p><li> <a href=http://muse.li>MUSE</a>, a MUltiscale MUltiphysics
     Scientific Environment for simulating dense stellar systems,
     hosted by the University of Amsterdam but open to the entire
     MODEST community.  The main objective of the project is the
     development of a modular software environment for modeling dense
     stellar systems, allowing packages written in different languages
     to interoperate within an integrated software framework. (See
     also the <a
     href=http://manybody.org/modest/Workshops/modest-7b.html>MODEST-7b</a>
     and <a
     href=http://manybody.org/modest/Workshops/modest-7c.html>MODEST-7c</a>
     workshops.)

<p>
<li> <a href=http://ArtCompSci.org>The Art of Computational
     Science</a>, by Piet Hut (IAS) and Jun Makino (Tokyo University),
     is a multi-volume book series aimed at providing a detailed
     introduction to simulating dense stellar systems, starting from a
     beginning undergraduate level.

<P>
<LI> Visit our <a href=binev.html>binary evolution</a> page.  Run and
     compare the results of the leading binary evolution packages.

<p>
<li> Download EZ, a robust standalone stellar evolution package,
     written by Bll Paxton (KITP).  The latest version is available on
     <a href=http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton>Bill's web site</a>.

<p>
<li> <a href=http://alum.mit.edu/www/fregeau/code.html>Fewbody</a> is
     a numerical toolkit for simulating small-N gravitational >
     dynamics, written by John Fregeau (Northwestern University).  It
     is particularly suited for performing binary scattering
     experiments, and can be freely downloaded from John's web site.

<p> <li> <a href=
    http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton/mesa/mesa_doc/index.html>MESA</a>
    (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), written by Bll
    Paxton (KITP).

<p>
<LI> The <a
     href=http://manybody.org/manybody/McScatter.html>McScatter</a>
     program, written by Douglas McHeggie (University of Edinburgh)
     and Simon McPortegies Zwart (University of Amsterdam).
     "Punctuated" binary evolution in a background stellar field.

<p>
<li> <a href=http://starcluster.org>Starcluster</a>, written by Ernest
     Mamikonyan and Steve McMillan (Drexel University), is a package
     of analysis and visualization tools for N-body systems, linked to
     the <a
     href=http://www.ids.ias.edu/~starlab/index.html>Starlab</a>
     libraries.  It also has several interactive demonstrations.

<P>
<LI> Here's a <A HREF="modest_star.html">toy model</a> implementation
     by Piet Hut (IAS) and Jun Makino (Tokyo University) of an
     interface between stellar dynamics and stellar evolution.

<P>
<LI> <A HREF=http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/j/jalombar/triptych/>
     Triptych</A>, by Jamie Lombardi (Allegheny College): Simulates the
     collision of two stars, including the pre-collision orbits and
     the evolution of the collision product.  Also has a <A
     HREF=http://143.229.45.51/cgi-bin/astro/triptych/triptych.pl> web
     interface</A>.

<P>
<LI> <A HREF=http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/j/jalombar/tripletych/>
     Tripletych</A>, by Jamie Lombardi (Allegheny College) and Steve
     McMillan (Drexel University): Simulates the interaction of three
     stars, including the orbits, possible merger(s), and the
     evolution of the merger product.  Also has a <A
     HREF=http://143.229.45.51/cgi-bin/astro/tripletych/tripletych.pl>
     web interface</A>.  Contact <a
     href="mailto:jalombar@allegheny.edu">Jamie</a> or <a
     HREF="mailto:steve@physics.drexel.edu">Steve</a> if you
     are interested in collaborating.

     Stars</a>, by Rob Izzard and Evert Glebbeek (Utrecht).  A
     graphical user interface to the popular TWIN single/binary
     stellar evolution code, for novices, students and professional
     astrophysicists.
