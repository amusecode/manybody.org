Most stars in most galaxies will never experience a collision or even
a close encounter with another star.  Typical collision time scales in
the solar neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy exceed the age of the
universe by many orders of magnitude, so physical stellar interactions
are extremely rare.  However, in some parts of the universe -- in
galactic nuclei and some star clusters -- circumstances have conspired
to create conditions in which physical collisions between stars are
commonplace events.  Such <i>dense stellar systems</i> stand at the
interface between stellar dynamics and stellar evolution.  Often owing
their existence to purely dynamical processes, dense stellar systems
offer wholly new channels for stars to evolve, allowing the formation
of stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and
binary evolutionary pathways.

<p> MODEST is a loosely knit collaboration between various groups
working in stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar
hydrodynamics.  Our aim is to provide a software framework for
large-scale simulations of dense stellar systems, within which
existing codes for dynamics, stellar evolution, and hydrodynamics can
be easily coupled.  While many of us have talked for years about
combining `live' stellar evolution codes directly with N-body
simulations, we have now reached a consensus between various groups
about standards and interfaces, what is needed, and what is doable.
On this web site we will provide up-to-date information about our
activities, and pointers to various projects in progress.

<p> Although neither we nor our project goals could possibly be
described as modest, we use the name also to indicate that we intend
only MODEST modifications of existing codes, in order to model dense
stellar systems.  So the acronym can also be read as MODifying
Existing STellar codes.
