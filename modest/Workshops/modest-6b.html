<h3>
September 15-16, 2005, 10 am - 5 pm, at the<br>
<a href="http://www.ias.edu/"> Institute for
Advanced Study</a>, Princeton, NJ, USA<br>
</h3>

The two main topics of this workshop are the ways to implement
performance enhancement of existing and future codes, and ways
to increase understandability and hence extendibility of these
codes.  Performance can be defined as the amount of physical
time that can be modeled with a given amount of CPU time, at
a given accuracy.  Therefore, we will discuss many different
ways of performance increase: from faster hardware to better
parallellization algorithms to better long-term accuracy of
algorithms to ways of improving memory management on single CPUs.
Transparency, or understandability, of codes will be discussed
by comparing various documentation strategies, beginning with
Knuth's concept of literate programming, that most recently has
been exemplified by James Quirk's

environment</a>.

<p> Note: the dictionary definition of "white elephant" is: a valuable
possession whose upkeep is excessively expensive.

<p> The meeting is open to all who are interested, but please do send
an email to <a href="http://www.ids.ias.edu/%7Epiet">Piet Hut</a> if
you would like to attend, so that we can add your name on the list of
participants.  In addition, if we know how many people to expect, we
will be able to reserve a room of the appropriate size.

<p><a href=modest-6b-participants.html>Here's</a> a list of participants.
