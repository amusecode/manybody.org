For a more complete list, try <a

the intersection of 32nd and Market Streets, in the "University City"
section of Philadelphia. 

<br><br>Perhaps more relevant, Drexel is 2 blocks from 30th Street
Station, the central rail station in Philadelphia.  Any hotel close to
a subway station or <b>any</b> regional rail line is close to 30th
Street, and hence to the meeting site.
