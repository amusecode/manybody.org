	  Visualization of Simulations<br>in<br>Dense Stellar Systems
</H1> </CENTER>

<br><blockquote>

<h3>
April 7, 2005, 10 am - 5 pm, at the<br>
<a href="http://www.ias.edu"> Institute for
Advanced Study</a>, Princeton, NJ, USA<br> in the West Building Seminar Room.
</h3>

We will hold an informal one-day workshop, to discuss various issues
in connection with visualization of simulations of dense stellar systems.
This meeting will be of interest especially for astrophysicists
working on these type of simulations, and computer scientists
interested in applying visualization techniques to novel areas.
<p>
The fact that particles in dense stellar systems simulations have
individual time steps already requires the development of special
techniques to allow efficient and flexible rendering of orbits in
movies and interactive graphic displays.  In addition, when stars
carry physical properties, such as temperature and luminosity, it is
interesting to plot simultaneously orbital information as well as,
say, a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram and other physical diagnostics.
This invites the development of an integrated visualization
environment, taylored or at least adapted to simulations of dense
stellar systems.
<p>
We will discuss the availability of existing packages, as well as
plans for extending and adapting those packages.  Specification of
interfaces will be an important topic, as well as the general question
of making N visualization packages and M simulation codes compatible
in a way that requires N+M rather than N*M adjustments.
<br>
<br>
The meeting is open to all who are interested.
