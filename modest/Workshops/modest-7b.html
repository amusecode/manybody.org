<!--
<H3> SUMMARY </H3>
-->

Traditionally, astrophysical simulations are performed to answer
specific theoretical questions or to model particular observed
systems.  A common side effect is that the simulations are often
closely tailored to the problem at hand, making critical comparison
between different simulations difficult, if not impossible.  A basic
goal of MODEST is to develop a common framework to allow different
research groups to make such comparisons.  Such a framework will also
make it easier to develop and share parts of modular codes, providing
standardized tools to facilitate a more systematic approach to
comparing simulations, both with one another and with observations.

<p>MODEST-7b <!-- is planned for --> will take place on January 18 -
21, 2007, at Drexel University, Philadelphia.  As usual, there is no
registration fee, but <b>please send e-mail</b> to <A
HREF="mailto:steve@physics.drexel.edu">
steve (at) physics.drexel.edu</A></I> if you are interested in
attending.

<p>The meeting will be held in room 2019/2020 MacAlister Hall.  

<p>As usual, there will be only a few formal presentations.  The
meeting will center on informal discussions on topics of broad
interest.  The main theme of the workshop will be the issues involved
in building and maintaining robust software for modeling, analyzing,
and visualizing dense stellar systems in astrophysics.  A working
model is the <a href=http://muse.li:80>MUSE</a> project.  Much of the
meeting will be devoted to MUSE, with the goals of adding new modules
and functionality to the existing framework and defining the
specifications of a more comprehensive environment.  We may also wish
to discuss progress on the 1-year "MODEST questions" defined 13 months
earlier at MODEST-6a, in Lund.
