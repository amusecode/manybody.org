accelerated by GPU; training in CUDA or OpenCL or in the use of other
application libraries using GPU.
<li>Support for data management and visualization.
<li>Develop and provide application libraries or code pieces in
collaboration with SFB project teams. A close collaboration within
some of the science projects and participation in the computationally
based research is possible and welcome.
<li>Present results in international computational science conferences
and develop visions for future projects and computing challenges.
</ul>

<p><b>II. Cyber Science Infrastructure</b>
<ul>

standard-compliance, and the like,
<li>operate simple data dissemination services on behalf of the SFB
and its scientists,
<li>work on the Virtual Observatory (VO)-compliant publication of SFB
generated data, either at the local data center or at suitable
international data centers,
<li>work with the wider VO community to develop further standards
serving the needs of the subcommunities represented within the SFB),
serve as advisor to SFB staff as to efficient use of VO and other
public data repositories,
<li>support SFB scientists in the use of web portals and standardized
scripts to access to exchange jobs and data with the SFB
supercomputing facilities, assist in further development of brokering
facilities e.g. in a grid-based environment.
</ul>

<p>Applicants should have at least a bachelor of science or equivalent
technical college degree, basic salary will be determined by Univ. of
Heidelberg according to degrees and experience of the candidate,
according to Baden-Wurttemberg public service tariff. Those with
master of science or similar may also apply. For application a
curriculum vitae, a list of publications, and a one-page summary of
capabilities and current and future interests related to the tasks
described above should be submitted.  Letters of recommendation by
previous employers or scientists familiar with the applicants work
should be sent to us as well (minimum one, not more than
three). Applications will be reviewed on a continous basis until the

with possible prolongation. Only electronic submissions in pdf format
will be considered.  Applications need to be submitted in a single pdf
file (except the recommendation letters).

astrophysics. We are particularly interested in candidates with
computational experience, to make use of the superb facilities at RIT
for gravitational dynamics simulations. These include a 32-node GRAPE
cluster with a speed of 4 Tflops; three, GRAPE-6 computers; and a 110
node general-purpose cluster. Among the topics of current research
interest at RIT are evolution of galactic nuclei, calculation of event
rates for gravitational wave detectors, and interaction of
supermassive black holes with their stellar and gaseous
environments. Outstanding candidates in related fields will also be
considered. The initial appointment will be for 2 years and may be
renewable for a third year. To apply, please send a CV and statement
of research interests and arrange for 2-3 letters of recommendation to
be sent to David Merritt at merritt@astro.rit.edu before January 15
2009.

<li><b>Postdoctoral Position in Computational Astrophysics at
Heidelberg University</b>

<p>The "Zentrum fur Astronomie" of Heidelberg University (ZAH) invites
applications for a postdoctoral research position in computational
astrophysics of dense stellar systems (galactic nuclei, star clusters,
direct N-body simulation). The position is located within the GRACE
project at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI), which is
constituting the ZAH with the "Institut fur Theoretische Astrophysik"
and the "Landessternwarte Konigstuhl."

<p>GRACE is an interdisciplinary research project and team, consisting
of members from the Universities of Heidelberg, Mannheim and Munich
(Astrophysics and Informatics), led by Prof. R. Spurzem. The aim is to
implement particle based algorithms for astrophysical N-body systems
and fluid flows on a new kind of special purpose hardware
(reconfigurable boards called MPRACE, which contain field-programmable
gate arrays, FPGA) and to apply them to key astrophysical problems in
the area of dense stellar systems, evolution of galaxies or galactic
nuclei.

<p>The successful candidate is expected to have a strong interest and
knowledge in software and hardware issues of high performance
computing, including the ability to support frequent and steady
interaction with our project partners from informatics. Experience in
one or more of the following fields is desirable: GRAPE systems, FPGA
programming, Beowulf PC clusters, or other high performance
supercomputers. The group uses primarily our GRACE supercomputer (32
GRAPE, 32 MPRACE, 32 Dual-Xeon nodes, 4 Tflops), and there is access
to federal German supercomputers (IBM, Blue Gene, CRAY XD1).

<p>The appointment is initially for 2 years. The salary is on the
German civil service level. Review of applications will begin March 3,
2006 and will continue until the post is filled. Applicants should
submit their CV, list of publications, and a brief statement of
research interests to the address above, and arrange for two letters
of reference, all preferably sent by e-mail. Heidelberg has a large
international community, also outside astrophysics. Heidelberg
University is an equal opportunity employer and particularly
encourages applications from women.
